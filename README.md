## Python Library

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/oni-framework.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/oni-framework)
[![Tests](https://github.com/qikevinl/ONI/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/qikevinl/ONI/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

The ONI Framework is available as a Python package for researchers and developers.

### Installation

```bash
pip install oni-framework
```

### Quick Start

```python
from oni import CoherenceMetric, NeuralFirewall, ONIStack

# Calculate signal coherence (Cₛ)
metric = CoherenceMetric(reference_freq=40.0)  # 40 Hz gamma band
cs = metric.calculate(
    arrival_times=[0.0, 0.025, 0.050, 0.075],
    amplitudes=[100, 98, 102, 99]
)
print(f"Coherence Score: {cs:.3f}")  # 0 = untrusted, 1 = fully coherent

# Use the Neural Firewall
firewall = NeuralFirewall(threshold_high=0.6, threshold_low=0.3)
from oni.firewall import Signal
signal = Signal(arrival_times=[0.0, 0.025], amplitudes=[100, 102], authenticated=True)
result = firewall.filter(signal)
print(f"Decision: {result.decision.name}")  # ACCEPT, ACCEPT_FLAG, or REJECT

# Explore the 14-layer model
stack = ONIStack()
print(stack.layer(8).name)  # "Neural Gateway" - the firewall layer
print(stack.ascii_diagram())  # Visual representation
```

## Objective

Brain-computer interfaces are being implanted in humans today, yet we lack standardized security frameworks for protecting neural communications. This project aims to:

1. **Establish shared vocabulary** — Define the attack surfaces, threat models, and defense mechanisms for neural interfaces before exploits emerge in the wild

2. **Bridge disciplines** — Translate cybersecurity principles into neuroscience contexts and vice versa, creating a common language for cross-domain collaboration

3. **Build proactively** — Develop security primitives (like the Coherence Metric) that can be implemented in hardware before BCIs reach mainstream adoption

4. **Invite scrutiny** — This framework is intentionally public and open. I want neuroscientists to challenge the biological assumptions, security researchers to find holes, and ethicists to identify governance gaps

**This is a living research project.** If you see flaws, have ideas, or want to collaborate — open an issue, submit a PR, or reach out directly. The goal isn't to be right; it's to build something robust enough to protect the most sensitive interface humanity will ever create: the one between technology and the mind.

## Key Components

### The 14-Layer ONI Model

Extends the traditional OSI model into biological territory:

| Layers | Domain | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| 1-7 | Traditional OSI | Physical → Application (standard networking) |
| 8-10 | Neural Interface | Electrodes, local field potentials, oscillatory patterns |
| 11-14 | Cognitive | Working memory, attention, executive function, identity |

### The Coherence Metric

Mathematical framework for validating neural signal trustworthiness:

```
Cₛ = e^(−(σ²φ + σ²τ + σ²γ))
```

| Component | Variable | Measures | Security Function |
|-----------|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Phase** | σ²φ | Timing jitter | Detects out-of-sync signal injections |
| **Transport** | σ²τ | Pathway reliability | Flags signals bypassing biological routes |
| **Gain** | σ²γ | Amplitude stability | Catches over/under-powered attacks |

**Interpretation:** Cₛ ranges from 0 (untrusted) to 1 (fully coherent). Signals below threshold are rejected before reaching neural tissue.

### Neural Signal Assurance Model (NSAM)

Physiology-first defense framework with checkpoints:

1. **Signal Existence** — Should this signal exist at all?
2. **Signal Integrity** — Is it biologically plausible?
3. **Intent & Context** — Does it make sense right now?
4. **Outcome Monitoring** — What effect is it causing?
5. **Human Sovereignty** — Does the human retain agency?

## Quick Reference

### Attack Surfaces by Layer

| Layer | Attack Surface | Example Threat |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| L1-2 | RF/Bluetooth | BlueBorne-style exploits |
| L3-4 | Protocol | Packet injection, replay attacks |
| L8 | Electrode | Signal injection at hardware |
| L9-10 | Neural | Phase-locked malicious stimulation |
| L11-14 | Cognitive | Memory manipulation, identity attacks |

### Hardware Constraints (Neuralink N1 Reference)

| Constraint | Value | Security Implication |
|------------|-------|---------------------|
| Power budget | 25mW total | Firewall gets ~3-5mW max |
| Latency | <1ms required | Real-time validation needed |
| Electrodes | 1,024 channels | High-bandwidth monitoring |
| Form factor | ~1mm² | Minimal silicon for security |
